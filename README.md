# Custom-GPT-Models-for-CAndidate-Pre-Assessment-via-CV-Analysis

Create custom GPT-based models tailored for our corporate clients. The goal is to develop a system that pre-assesses candidates for migration by analyzing their uploaded CVs. This tool will help our clients efficiently evaluate potential candidates based on predefined criteria relevant to migration eligibility and job suitability.

Key Responsibilities:

Model Development:
Develop custom GPT models capable of understanding and analyzing CVs.
Train the models to assess candidates based on specific criteria provided by us and our clients.
Data Processing:
Implement solutions to handle various CV formats (PDF, Word, etc.).
Extract and structure relevant information from unstructured CV data.
Integration & Interface:
Create a user-friendly interface for candidates to upload their CVs.
Develop dashboards or reports for clients to view assessment results.
Testing & Validation:
Perform thorough testing to ensure accuracy and reliability of assessments.
Iterate based on feedback to improve model performance.
Documentation & Support:
Provide comprehensive documentation of the developed system.
Offer training sessions or materials for our team and clients.
Qualifications:

Proven experience in AI/ML development, specifically with GPT or similar language models.
Strong background in natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics.
Familiarity with data extraction from unstructured documents.
Experience in developing user interfaces and integrating AI models into applications.
Knowledge of migration processes and candidate assessment is a plus.
Proficiency in programming languages such as Python and frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
Deliverables:

Customized GPT model(s) tailored to our assessment needs.
A functional application for CV upload and analysis.
Source code and implementation scripts.
Documentation covering system architecture, usage guidelines, and maintenance procedures.
Training materials for end-users and administrators.

===================
Hereâ€™s a Python code framework for developing a custom GPT-based system to analyze and assess CVs for migration eligibility and job suitability. The solution is broken into modules for clarity and modularity.
Code Framework
1. Environment Setup

pip install openai fastapi pydantic python-multipart pdfplumber python-docx pandas numpy

2. Code Implementation

import openai
import pdfplumber
from docx import Document
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
from pydantic import BaseModel
import pandas as pd

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

# FastAPI app initialization
app = FastAPI()

# Define candidate assessment criteria
CRITERIA = {
    "experience_years": "How many years of relevant experience does the candidate have?",
    "education_level": "What is the highest level of education completed?",
    "skills": "List the technical and soft skills mentioned.",
    "languages": "Does the candidate have language proficiency in English or other relevant languages?",
    "migration_eligibility": "Assess if the candidate is eligible for migration based on their experience and education."
}

# Function to extract text from PDFs
def extract_text_from_pdf(file):
    with pdfplumber.open(file) as pdf:
        text = ''.join(page.extract_text() for page in pdf.pages)
    return text

# Function to extract text from Word documents
def extract_text_from_docx(file):
    doc = Document(file)
    return '\n'.join([para.text for para in doc.paragraphs])

# GPT-based analysis
def analyze_cv(cv_text: str):
    prompt = "Analyze the following CV text and provide insights:\n\n" + cv_text + "\n\n"
    prompt += "\n".join([f"{key}: {question}" for key, question in CRITERIA.items()])
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1000
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# API endpoint for CV upload
@app.post("/upload-cv/")
async def upload_cv(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    try:
        # Extract text based on file type
        if file.filename.endswith(".pdf"):
            cv_text = extract_text_from_pdf(file.file)
        elif file.filename.endswith(".docx"):
            cv_text = extract_text_from_docx(file.file)
        else:
            return {"error": "Unsupported file type. Please upload a PDF or DOCX."}
        
        # Analyze CV using GPT
        analysis_result = analyze_cv(cv_text)
        
        return {"filename": file.filename, "analysis": analysis_result}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}

Key Features in the Code

    Text Extraction:
        Handles both PDF and DOCX formats for extracting text from CVs.

    GPT-based Analysis:
        Uses GPT (via OpenAI API) to analyze the CV text based on predefined criteria.
        Criteria are customizable for different clients' requirements.

    FastAPI Framework:
        Provides an API endpoint for easy file uploads and CV analysis.
        Can be integrated with a web application or CRM.

To Enhance the Solution:

    Database Integration:
        Use SQLite or a cloud database (e.g., Firebase, PostgreSQL) to store analyzed CV data for future reference.

    Dashboard:
        Build a dashboard using a frontend framework like React.js to display results dynamically.

    Feedback Loop:
        Incorporate user feedback to refine the GPT model's responses over time.

    Scoring System:
        Develop a weighted scoring system based on the predefined criteria to rank candidates.

    Multi-language Support:
        Include language detection and translation for non-English CVs using libraries like langdetect or APIs like Google Translate.

Deliverables:

    API Endpoint:
        A functional API to process CV uploads and return analyzed results.

    Documentation:
        User guide explaining the API usage and system architecture.

    Deployment:
        Host the solution on AWS/GCP/Azure or a containerized environment using Docker.

    Training Material:
        Detailed documentation or tutorials for end-users.

By following this framework, you can develop a robust solution tailored to the specific needs of analyzing CVs for migration and job suitability.
